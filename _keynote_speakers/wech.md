abstract: 'Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) calculation is the most crucial analysis at ultra-high-field (UHF) 7T MRI, as it is related to patient safety. Current SAR computation methods rely on computationally intensive simulations, which are often impractically long for real-time clinical use. **Goal:** This study aims to develop a physics-informed neural network (PINN) capable of predicting electromagnetic (EM) field distribution at 7T MRI. **Approach**: A neural network is trained using data generated from EM simulations. One of Maxwell’s equations is implemented as a physical constraint within the neural network to improve the accuracy of the field prediction. **Results**: Introducing physics into neural networks enhances EM field prediction accuracy across the entire simulation domain. **Impact:** This study proposes a deep learning-based method for EM field prediction, which, by significantly reducing the computational time, can enable safer and more accessible 7T MRI.
