## About

Prof. Wech is a physicist specializing in the development of advanced MRI methods, with a focus on model- and data-driven image reconstruction techniques. His work enables the conversion of MR scans, which were accelerated by undersampling, into high-quality medical images, thereby leading to more efficient, affordable, and accessible MRI scans, while improving patient comfort through shorter investigations. In cardiac imaging, faster acquisition speeds unlock new possibilities, such as real-time MRI and free-breathing examinations, eliminating the need for repeated breath-holding. Diffusion probabilistic models, which are conditioned by undersampled MR scans represent a recent reseach interest. <br> His publication on compressed sensing in functional cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is available on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=de&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=+Prof.+Dr.+Tobias+Wech&oq=wech">google scholar</a>
