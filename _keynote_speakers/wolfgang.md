## About

Professor Wolfgang Rudolf Bauer, holding both an MD and a PhD, completed his education at the University of M端nster and the Technical University of Munich before joining the University Hospital of W端rzburg in 1989, where he has risen to the position of Executive Senior Physician of the Medical Department. He leads the research group "Cardiac MRI and Biophysics" and is the head of Clinical Electrophysiology and MRI Imaging at UKW. His research focuses on developing advanced cardiovascular imaging techniques, particularly in understanding myocardial microcirculation and its role in heart failure7. Prof. Bauer's work encompasses both non-contrast and contrast-agent-based methods, including blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) imaging and quantitative relaxation time mapping. He also explores molecular and cellular imaging approaches for atherosclerosis and myocardial healing, integrating biophysical modeling to quantify physiological and microstructural parameters through MRI.
