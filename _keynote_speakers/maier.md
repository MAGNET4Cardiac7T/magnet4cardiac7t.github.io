## About

Professor Andreas Maier completed his studies in Computer Science at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), progressing from graduation in 2005 to his current role as professor and head of the Pattern Recognition Lab, which he assumed in 2015.

Professor Maier's research interests span several interconnected areas of computer science and medical technology. His primary focus is on medical imaging, encompassing image and audio processing techniques. He has made significant contributions to the field of digital humanities, particularly through his involvement with the European Time Machine Consortium since 2016. Additionally, his work extends to interpretable machine learning and the application of known operators in AI systems. Professor Maier's research has led to innovations in speech processing, including the development of PEAKS, an online speech intelligibility assessment tool. His current projects involve the use of AI in medical imaging, such as developing speech-driven generative AI for personalized Cine-MRI sequence generation in clinical speech therapy.
