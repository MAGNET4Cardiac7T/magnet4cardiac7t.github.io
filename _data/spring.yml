                description: "Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming cardiology, from automated image analysis to predictive risk modelling and AI-driven decision support. This keynote will explore the current landscape of AI applications in cardiovascular medicine, focusing on its role in cardiac imaging, diagnosis, risk stratification, and personalized therapy. While AI has demonstrated remarkable capabilities—enhancing diagnostic accuracy, improving workflow efficiency, and enabling early disease detection—its real-world deployment faces critical challenges, including bias, interpretability, regulatory constraints, and clinical integration. This talk will bridge the gap between AI research and clinical practice, providing insights into successful applications, ongoing limitations, and the future of AI in cardiovascular medicine. The session will conclude with a discussion on open questions and future research directions to foster collaboration between AI scientists and clinicians."

                description: The presentation focuses on physics-based machine learning for cardiac MRI reconstruction. We'll begin with a brief overview of cardiac MRI, outlining its potential and current challenges. We will then define physics-based machine learning in MR reconstruction, contrasting it with alternative approaches of transforming undersampled acquisitions into high-quality images. A key component of physics-based methods is ensuring data consistency, and we will discuss the critical role of transfer functions in modeling gradient behavior and accurately determining k-space trajectories. We will then explore diffusion probabilistic models, a powerful generative approach that has shown significant promise for physics-based MR reconstruction, and demonstrate its potential for high-quality cardiac MRI.

                description: |
                      In 2016, machine learning techniques have been first introduced to solve the inverse problem of MR image generation from accelerated acquisitions (1,2,3). 
                      Since then, the field has grown substantially, and a wide range of machine learning methods have been developed, applied to a wide range of imaging applications 
                      and already rolled out as clinical products by all major scanner manufacturers.
                    
                      In this lecture, I will start with the background of an artificial intelligence process to generate MR images from the acquired measurement data. 
                      In particular, I will discuss physics informed architectures that map iterative algorithms onto neural networks. 
                      I will discuss their performance for a range of clinical applications (4,5,6) as well as ongoing challenges related to data availability (7), 
                      generalizability and validation of the results. I will also include a discussion of the lessons learnt from the recent fastMRI image reconstruction 
                      challenges organized jointly with Facebook AI research (8).
