                    Bridging Domain Expertise with AI for Next-Generation MRI: Known
                    Operators, Low-Field Applications, Contrast Discovery, and Sequence
                    Programming <br><br>

                    Recent advances in deep learning have enabled the seamless integration
                    of known operators—such as Fourier transforms and physical forward
                    models—into neural architectures, greatly enhancing the fidelity and
                    interpretability of medical image reconstruction. In low-field MRI,
                    variational networks leverage these operator constraints to stabilise
                    the iterative reconstruction process, compensating for reduced
                    signal-to-noise ratios while preserving essential anatomical
                    information. Furthermore, the paradigm of differentiable MRI
                    reconstruction opens new horizons in sequence design by allowing the
                    joint optimization of sampling trajectories in k-space with respect to
                    specific signal characteristics. Approaches like MRZero permit
                    model-driven discovery of scanning protocols, reducing the need for
                    labor-intensive experimentation. Going one step further, the GPT4MR
                    initiative harnesses generative large language models (e.g., OpenAI o1
                    or xAI’s Grok) to reason about MRI physics and pulse sequences, offering
                    intuitive programming support for sequence development. The synergy of
                    operator-based deep networks, differentiable reconstruction pipelines,
                    and next-generation language models sets a new direction for innovation
                    in MRI, promising enhanced image quality, reduced acquisition times, and
                    unprecedented adaptability in clinical and research settings.

This keynote will explore the current landscape of AI applications in cardiovascular medicine, focusing on its role in cardiac imaging, diagnosis, risk stratification, and personalized therapy. While AI has demonstrated remarkable capabilities—enhancing diagnostic accuracy, improving workflow efficiency, and enabling early disease detection—its real-world deployment faces critical challenges, including bias, interpretability, regulatory constraints, and clinical integration. This talk will bridge the gap between AI research and clinical practice, providing insights into successful applications, ongoing limitations, and the future of AI in cardiovascular medicine. The session will conclude with a discussion on open questions and future research directions to foster collaboration between AI scientists and clinicians."

                description: The presentation focuses on physics-based machine learning for cardiac MRI reconstruction. We'll begin with a brief overview of cardiac MRI, outlining its potential and current challenges. We will then define physics-based machine learning in MR reconstruction, contrasting it with alternative approaches of transforming undersampled acquisitions into high-quality images. A key component of physics-based methods is ensuring data consistency, and we will discuss the critical role of transfer functions in modeling gradient behavior and accurately determining k-space trajectories. We will then explore diffusion probabilistic models, a powerful generative approach that has shown significant promise for physics-based MR reconstruction, and demonstrate its potential for high-quality cardiac MRI.

                    The hackathon is an opportunity for participants to work on a specific project or problem related to the topics covered in the Spring School. 
                    Participants will be divided into teams and will have the chance to collaborate, share ideas, and develop solutions. 
                    The hackathon will be supervised to answer questions and provide guidance.
                    Participants are encouraged to bring their own laptops and any materials they may need for the hackathon.

                      In 2016, machine learning techniques have been first introduced to solve the inverse problem of MR image generation from accelerated acquisitions (1,2,3). 
                      Since then, the field has grown substantially, and a wide range of machine learning methods have been developed, applied to a wide range of imaging applications 
                      and already rolled out as clinical products by all major scanner manufacturers.
                    
                      In this lecture, I will start with the background of an artificial intelligence process to generate MR images from the acquired measurement data. 
                      In particular, I will discuss physics informed architectures that map iterative algorithms onto neural networks. 
                      I will discuss their performance for a range of clinical applications (4,5,6) as well as ongoing challenges related to data availability (7), 
                      generalizability and validation of the results. I will also include a discussion of the lessons learnt from the recent fastMRI image reconstruction 
                      challenges organized jointly with Facebook AI research (8).
