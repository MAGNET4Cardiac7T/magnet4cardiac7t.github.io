## About me
I received my Diploma in Electrical Engineering from the Technical University Dresden in 2009. 
In the same year, I joined Prof. Erich Barke's Electronic Design Automation Group at the Institute of Microelectronic Systems at the University of Hannover. 
I researched methods for automatically generating behavioral models of analog circuits with parameter variations. 
My thesis is on the adaptation of Support Vector Machines to generate models with interval-valued parameters. 
I received my doctorate degree from the University of Hannover in 2019. In 2016, I joined Robert Bosch GmbH Corporate Research as a research engineer. 
I joined the Chair X (Data Science) in 2019 as a post-doctoral researcher, where I am currently leading the Deep Learning for Dynamical Systems Group.

## Projects and Research Interests
I am currently doing research in Environmental Sensing and Time Series Analysis. 
I am interested in furthering methods to enhance existing physics-based models - such as meteorological models, and to further our understanding based on data obtained by sparse and dynamic sensor networks.
