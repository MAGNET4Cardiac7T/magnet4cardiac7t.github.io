## About me

I obtained my B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering from Urmia University, Urmia, Iran, in 2013 and 2016, respectively. I then pursued my Ph.D. with the Antenna Group at the Université Catholique de Louvain, Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, from 2019 to 2023. Since 2023, I have been a postdoctoral researcher in the Cardiovascular Imaging Department at the Comprehensive Heart Failure Center (CHFC) in Würzburg, Germany. My research focuses on antenna design, numerical electromagnetics, development of radio-frequency (RF) coils for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and SAR safety analysis at ultra-high-field (UHF) MRI.
